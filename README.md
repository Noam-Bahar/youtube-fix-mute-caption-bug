# Fix YouTube Mute Caption Bug

Prevents YouTube subtitles from shrinking when pressing the mute key.

## How to use?

As of now (April 16th, 2025) I have not published this as an extension in the Chrome Web Store. I will do this if there's demand.

Therefore, you need to manually load the extension's code into your browser.

1. On GitHub, [download the repository as a ZIP file](https://github.com/Noam-Bahar/youtube-fix-mute-caption-bug/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or `git clone` it if you prefer

2. Go to [the Chrome Extensions manager page](chrome://extensions), and turn on _Developer mode_

3. Ensure that the extension's folder has the following 2 files: `manifest.json` and `content.js`

3. Drag the extension's folderinto the Extensions page and drop it anywhere on the page, and the extension will be created
